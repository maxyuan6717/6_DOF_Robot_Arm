# 6_DOF_Robot_Arm
 STL and Code files for my 6 DOF Robot Arm. I designed, built, wired, and programmed this robot arm over the course of 3 months during the summer before my senior year of high school.  The arm can be programmed to repeat a sequence of moves using the buttons on the controller arm, and data is transmitted via radio using 2 nRF24L01 tranceivers.
 
 Big_Arm.ino is the code for the actual robot arm that mimics the movements of the smaller, controller arm. Small_Arm.ino is the code for the controller arm.
